This paper was presented by Simon Rouchier at IBPC 2021 in Copenhagen.

This paper investigates perturbation methods to design a 24-h heat input signal that would ensure an accuracy similar to or better than other perturbation methods to estimate an overall thermal resistance of the building envelope.
The paper studies 256 different squared heating signals in a numerical methodology to determine common characteristics of high-scoring 24-h signals.
An experimental campaign in a wooden-framed house tested one of the high-scoring signals.
The experimental results showed estimation errors higher than expected but consistent with the literature.
