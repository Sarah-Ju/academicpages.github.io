On-site measurement of the actual thermal performance of a building envelope could considerably benefit
to the building sector by securing an effective perfor-mance of newly built or retrofitted buildings. Current
methods to estimate the Heat Transfer Coefficient, for example, suffer however from either excessive equip-
ment downtime and therefore large costs, or fail to achieve a reasonable accuracy. This paper aims therefore
at developing and assessing an original 24-hour perturbation method for estimating a whole-building Heat
Transfer Coefficient. Based on a binary heating signal, the proposed method exploits the data collected with
stochastic RC models.

The paper first presents a numerical comparison of 398 binary signals along with variable initial indoor
temperatures to bring out common characteristics of signals that achieve highly accurate HTC estimations.
An experimental campaign in a highly insulated wooden-framed house then implemented one particular
signal and assessed its reproducibility under variable weather conditions. The paper shows that the proposed
24-hour method indeed achieves a highly accurate estimation when performed in cold weather. In mid-season
conditions, the method shows a better robustness from 30- to 36-hour measurements. The results invite to
further investigate other building types in variable weather conditions to validate the proposed method.
